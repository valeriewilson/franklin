## Statement of Purpose

Most of the things I take care of everyday are split between calendars and task lists.  Every week, I plan out the coming week, figuring out how to get from point A to B based on my schedule and when I can tackle the items on my to-do list given my plans.  I would like to spend less of my time planning and more time doing what I enjoy and/or need to get done.
